# Module 4 Challenge

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this project was to create line, bar, scatter, bubble, pie, and box-and-whisker plots using Matplotlib of ride-share data for CyBer to help improve ride sharing services. Values like mean, median, and mode were found using pandas and NumPy as well. 

## Results
-The urban fares started at an average of around $1800 and had a steady increase to over $2200. 
-The rural fares started at around $200 and had times where they were increasing and decreasing until the end of the month of April.
-The suburban fare prices started at around $1000 and was not really profitable in March through mid-April. 
-Some of the results that could be found after taking a look at the multiple line chart was that there are more rides in Urban cities than Suburban or Rural. Urban had 68.4% while suburban followed with 26.3%, and lastly, rural, with 5.3%. 
-The percent of total drivers by city type follow the same pattern with more drivers being in Urban cities. Urban had 80.9% while suburban followed with 16.5%, and lastly, rural, with 2.6%. 
-The average fare per ride with the average fare per driver are most expensive in the rural cities and less expensive in the urban cities. While rural city ride prices are higher, more dare dollars are made up from urban city fares. Urban had 62.7% while suburban followed with 30.5%, and lastly, rural, with 6.8%. 
-The fares looked consistent over time for all three even when they were peaking and dipping. Urban brought in the most fare dollars followed by suburban, and lastly rural. 

## Summary
There are a couple business recommendations that could be made to the CEO. One of the biggest recommendations that could be made for both the suburban and rural cities was that they could hire more drivers. This could be beneficial to both, but more beneficial to rural cities. One recommendation for urban cities is that they can expand where their rides go to in order to increase fare prices. They can go a little farther out of the urban territory and expand their radius to make more money.
